## Design

Putting myself in the user's position and trying to anticipate their needs, here are some example of questions I have asked myself:

* Why would a user wish to visit the <em>What's for Dinner</em> website?
* What would make the users return?

After some design thinking work, I came up with the following.

As a site user, I would like to:
* Take a look at a list of recipes, from where I can select a recipe to view.
* Spend some time viewing one recipe at a time, until I decide on one to prepare for dinner.
* Be able to use my smartphone to view the recipe I have selected, so that I can view any details of this recipe while I am cooking.
* Enjoy dinner, knowing I can count on <em>What's for Dinner</em> website next time.

I would return if I liked the user experience when browsing, reading, preparing/cooking the recipe and having dinner.

### User Stories

These are the users stories I have defined for the first version of the website.

* Welcome page: As a Site User I can view the welcome/landing page so that I can log in or create an account
* Create account: As a Site User I can create/register an account so that I can log in to the website
* Log in: As a Registered Site User I can log in to the website so that I can create a recipe, edit any recipe I created and delete any recipe I created

* Edit recipe: As a Registered Site User I can edit a recipe I created so that people can view a better version of this recipe in the website
